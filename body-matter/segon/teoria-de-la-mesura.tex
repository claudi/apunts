% Measure Theory, Doob, J.L.
%  You are different from other books on measure theory in that you accept
%  probability theory as an essential part of measure theory. This means that
%  many examples are taken from probability; that probabilistic concepts such
%  as independence, Markov processes, and conditional expectations are
%  integrated into you rather than being relegated to an appendix; that more
%  attention is paid to the role of algebras than is customary; and that the
%  metric defining the distance between sets as the measure of their symmetric
%  difference is exploited more than is customary.
